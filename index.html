          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
          Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
          environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
          elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety
          of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
            Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on
            an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
          </li>
          <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
            server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide
            continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations
            on a server.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
          language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows
          most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it
          was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime
          system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has
          a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
          provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
          supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects,
          executing as loosely typed methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes,
          and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you
          do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly
          typed.

      <header>Data Types</header>
      <article>
        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Six data types that are primitives:
            <ul>
              <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
              <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the
                same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
              <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
              <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
              <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
              <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>and Object</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="main-section" id="if_else_statement">
      <header>If Else Statement</header>
      <article>
        <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to
          execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
        </p>
        <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
        <p>
          condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what
          evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2
          is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.
        </p>
        <p>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as
          follows:
        </p>
        <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
          } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
        </code>
        <p>
          In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed.
          To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
          to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:
        </p>
        <code>if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
          statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
          statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
          statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }
        </code>
        <p>
          It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be
          confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
        </p>
        <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code>
        <p>
          If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional
          parentheses around the assignment. For example:
        </p>
        <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
      <header>While Statement</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while
          statement looks as follows:
        </p>
        <code>while (condition) statement</code>
        <p>
          If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement
          following the loop.
        </p>
        <p>
          The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement
          is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is
          passed to the statement following while.
        </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="function_declarations">
      <header>Function Declarations</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function
          keyword, followed by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The name of the function.</li>
          <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
          <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
        <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
        <p>
          The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to
          return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the
          value returned by the function.
        </p>
        <code>return number * number;</code>
        <p>
          Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function,
          but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the
          calling function.
